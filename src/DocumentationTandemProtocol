The Tandem verifier is expecting to communicate with the device under test (DUT):
- It asks on stdout for the next packet with "n"
(- It closes with n)

The DUT is communicating back Verification Packet:
- The protocol is:

s
64bits of pc in hex
32bits of instruction in hex
32 bits of exception in hex
32 bits on interrupt in hex
8 bits cause
64 bits of addr (where it could store/load)
64 bits of data (what it is gonna store/regsiter write)
8 bits of dst register: 5 bits of index, one bit of FPU/GPR, one bit of valid.
e

The binary is going to complaint if spike the DUT diverge (for some notion of divergence).
